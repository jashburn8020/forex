# Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices

## Introduction: From Management Boom to Management Performance

### 1. The Emergence of Management

* **Shift to an Institutional Society:** Over the past 50 years, developed countries have transitioned into societies dominated by large institutions.
* **Institutional Responsibility:** Major societal tasks (economy, healthcare, education, environment, knowledge, defense) are now handled by these perpetual, professionally managed organizations.
* **Dependence on Institutions:** Modern society's performance and individual survival increasingly rely on these institutions.
* **Contrast with 1900 Society:**
  * In 1900, the family was the primary agent for most social tasks.
  * Institutions were few and small, with the central government being the only significant "eminence."
  * Society was diffused, consisting of countless small entities like workshops, individual professionals, farmers, craftsmen, and small retail stores.
* **Growth of Organizations:**
  * What was considered "giant business" in 1900 (e.g., Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust) would be considered very small today.
  * Even after the 1911 breakup, individual Standard Oil "daughters" grew significantly, with some becoming major global players.
  * Other institutions like universities, hospitals, labor unions, and research institutes have grown even faster and become far more complex.
  * The example of Zurich City Hall illustrates the vast and unforeseen growth of government administration, even in a country with comparatively slow governmental expansion.

#### The Employee Society

* **Prevalence of the Employee:** In developed countries today, the typical citizen is an employee, working for institutions for livelihood, opportunities, social status, and personal fulfillment.
* **Contrast with 1900:** In 1900, employed individuals often worked for small, family-run operations (e.g., "pop-and-mom" stores, family households), or, for the majority, on farms.
* **Societal Shift:** Society has transitioned into an "employee society," evident in the common question changing from "What do you do?" to "Whom do you work for?"
* **Lack of Theoretical Framework:**
  * Current political and social theories, rooted in 16th and 17th-century thought (e.g., Bodin, Locke), are incompatible with the new reality of a pluralistic society dominated by autonomous institutions and multiple power centers beyond a single central government.
  * While new theories are needed, they emerge *after* events and codify existing knowledge and actions, meaning we cannot wait for a complete theory before acting.
* **The Role of Management:**
  * Management is identified as the "specific organ" of these new institutions, regardless of their type (business, university, hospital, military, research lab, government agency).
  * For institutions to function, their managements must perform.
* **Defining "Management":**
  * The term "management" is uniquely American and difficult to translate precisely into other languages.
  * It encompasses a function, the people who perform it, a social position/rank, and a discipline/field of study.
  * While other institutions use terms like "administrators," "commanders," or "executives," they all share the fundamental "management function, task, and work."
* **Management as the Active Organ:**
  * Institutions themselves are presented as "fictions" or "accounting realities," not social realities.
  * Decisions and actions attributed to institutions are, in fact, made and executed by groups of people within them â€“ the managers/executives.
  * Quoting Georg Siemens, the text emphasizes that "Without management, a bank is so much scrap, fit only to be liquidated," highlighting that institutions cannot exist or perform without effective management.
  * Management is thus the active organ upon whose performance the institution's performance and survival depend.

#### Management Is Professional

* **Independence of Management:** Management is distinct from ownership, rank, or power. Its nature is objective and should be based on the responsibility for performance.
* **Professional Nature:** Management is a profession, encompassing a specific function, a discipline, and a set of tasks. Managers are the professionals who execute these responsibilities.
* **Irrelevance of Ownership:** A manager's role as an owner is incidental to their primary function, which is to manage.
* **Fulfillment of an Ideal:** The "professional manager" ideal, as conceived by Eiichi Shibusawa in early modern Japan, has materialized.
* **Essence of Management is Responsibility:** Shibusawa's core insight, that a manager's essence lies in responsibility rather than wealth or rank, is now a reality.

#### From Business Society to Pluralism

* **Shift from Business Dominance:** The idea of Western society as a "big-business society" is outdated. While business was the most powerful institution 75 years ago, its relative importance has declined because other institutions have grown much faster, leading to a pluralist society.
* **Declining Influence of Business Tycoons:** Unlike the early 1900s (e.g., J.P. Morgan, Rockefeller), today's business leaders in the U.S. lack the same level of public visibility or power; even the largest corporations don't wield the influence of past tycoons.
* **Emergence of New Power Centers (e.g., Universities):** The concept of a "military-industrial complex" is less accurate than a "military-university complex," as universities now hold unprecedented power (e.g., controlling access to jobs through admissions and degrees) that no business in American history ever possessed.
* **Similar Trends in Europe:** While business careers have gained respectability in Europe, no current business figure rivals the power of families like the DeWendels in France or the Krupps in Germany from earlier eras.
* **Japan as a Partial Exception:** Japan is the closest to a "business society," with business management holding significant influence, but even there, no single business or manager matches the societal impact of previous decades.
* **Growing Need for Management in Non-Business Institutions:** Non-business, public-service institutions, such as government agencies, hospitals, and armed services, are increasingly recognized as needing management, potentially even more so than businesses.
* **Rise of Management Consulting in Public Sector:** Major management consulting firms are increasingly serving non-business clients like the Department of Defense, the City of New York, and the Bank of England.
* **Integration of Management Principles:** Examples like the unified Canadian military's focus on "management by objectives" and the Catholic Church's organizational studies demonstrate the adoption of management practices outside traditional business.
* **Management Focus in Public Administration:** Cities like Hamburg and the British civil service are actively implementing management principles and creating management centers.
* **Demand for Management Education:** There's a growing trend of non-business executives (from hospitals, military, government, education) enrolling in advanced management courses, including specialized programs for university presidents.
* **Future Centrality of Public Sector Management:** The management of non-business institutions is projected to become a central management challenge due to the glaring weaknesses often found in public-service organizations.
* **Business Management as the Exemplar:** Despite the growing importance of management in non-business sectors, business management remains the primary model and focal point for discussions and books on management.

#### Why Business Management Has to Be the Focus

* **Historical Precedence:** Business enterprises, like railroads and "universal banks," were the **first modern institutions** to emerge in the late 19th century, distinctly new unlike other institutions that appeared to evolve from older forms. While other institutions had sporadic management concerns, business management was continuously and generically studied from its inception.
* **Measurable Results:** The economic sphere, primarily business, possesses **quantifiable measurements** for resource allocation and decision outcomes, like profitability. Although imperfect and hard to define, it provides a concrete basis for a discipline, unlike other institutions that primarily rely on opinions.
* **Economic Success Story:** Business management is highlighted as the **major success story of the 20th century**. It has profoundly increased the availability of economic goods and services, something unimaginable in 1900, despite global challenges like wars and depressions.
* **Societal Contributions:**
  * Business management's achievements offer the potential to **abolish extreme poverty**.
  * It enables advanced societies to **afford mass higher education** by providing economic means and jobs for knowledge workers.
  * It has contributed to the societal shift where **opportunities are no longer solely dictated by class or birth**, a change driven by economic performance.
* **Transnational Force:** In an increasingly fragmented and nationalistic world, business management, especially through **multinational corporations**, serves as one of the few institutions capable of transcending national boundaries. These corporations unite diverse people from various countries, cultures, and languages for a common purpose, acting as a "common organ of a world economy" in the absence of a global political body.
* **Leadership in Quality of Life:** Society increasingly looks to business management for **leadership in improving the quality of life**. Perceived criticisms often reflect high expectations based on its past successes.
* **Foundation for Broader Management Study:** Despite dedicating a significant portion of the book to non-business service institutions and anticipating that their management will be the "frontier" for the rest of the century, **business management must remain the foundational focus** for any work on the subject.
* **Pivotal and Rapid Emergence:** The emergence of management is presented as a **pivotal event of our time**, rapidly establishing itself as an indispensable new institution and leading social function since the turn of the century. Its global reach, crossing boundaries of race, creed, language, and tradition, has been unprecedented and met with remarkably little opposition or controversy.
* **Dependence on Managerial Leadership:** Modern developed society, lacking traditional aristocracies, landowners, or tycoons, **relies on the knowledge, vision, and responsibility of managers** across its major institutions for leadership. Management, its tasks, responsibilities, and practices, are central as a need, a contribution, and a field of study.
