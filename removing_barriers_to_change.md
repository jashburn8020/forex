## Module 1: The Challenge of Change

### The Challenge of Change

* **Everyone Wants to Change Something:** From employees and leaders to parents and startups, everyone seeks to change minds, behaviors, or systems. Yet, change is difficult, and even the best efforts often feel ineffective.
* **Introducing the Science of Change:** Jonah Berger, a marketing professor at Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, introduces insights from his book The Catalyst: How to Change Anyone’s Mind, which focuses on understanding why change is hard and how to make it easier.
* **Status Quo Bias as a Core Barrier:** A central reason change is difficult is the **status quo bias**—people prefer sticking with what they know, even when better alternatives exist.
* **Anecdote: Jonah’s Phone Dilemma:** Berger tells a personal story about clinging to an old phone he loved despite its memory and performance issues.
  * Though the new phone had better features, its larger size felt like a dealbreaker.
  * Despite serious inconveniences—like no mobile boarding passes—he resisted change for months.
  * Even after the new phone arrived, he didn’t open the box for three months, showing how emotionally and psychologically sticky the status quo can be.
* **Better ≠ Enough:** New solutions may be technically superior, but that alone doesn't drive adoption. People need a compelling reason to leave the familiar behind.
* **Loss Aversion is Powerful:** People are more sensitive to losses than to gains. This is called **loss aversion**—losing $100 feels worse than winning $100 feels good.
* **Coin Flip Thought Experiment:** Berger uses a simple example:
  * Would you take a 50/50 bet to win or lose $100? Most say no.
  * Even with a gain of $102, most still wouldn’t take the risk.
  * Research shows that **gains must be about twice as large as losses** to persuade people to take a chance.
* **Implication: New Solutions Must Be Way Better:** If a change requires people to give up something (comfort, familiarity, control), the benefits must be at least 2x better—not just a little improvement.
* **Hidden Costs Discourage Change:** Even when monetary costs are low, people consider hidden costs: time, effort, decision fatigue, fear of regret.
  * For instance, buying a new router isn’t just about money—it’s also about researching options, setting it up, and learning a new interface.
* **The Phone Example as a Metaphor for Change Resistance:** Berger’s reluctance to switch phones despite obvious benefits mirrors how organizations and individuals cling to outdated systems, behaviors, and tools, even when new options are better.

**Key Insights:**

* Change is resisted not because new things are worse, but because people overweight the pain of loss.
* Loss aversion and the status quo bias make people stay put unless the benefits are dramatically better.
* Effective change agents must address both the benefits of change and the costs of switching.
* Understanding psychological barriers is as important as offering a better solution.

### Getting People to Change

* **The Default Approach to Change is "Pushing":** Most people instinctively try to push others into change—by providing more facts, sending more emails, making more calls, or explaining again why their perspective is right. This mirrors how we physically move objects: by applying force.
* **Pushing Often Backfires in Human Interaction:** Unlike inanimate objects, people don’t simply move when pushed. Instead, they resist, ignore, or push back, which can entrench their existing behavior rather than change it.
* **Over 99% of Change Attempts Rely on Pushing:** When people are asked how they've tried to create change, almost all responses involve some form of pushing—information overload, repetition, or persuasion through logic or emotion.
* **Anecdote – Rethinking the Strategy Through Research:** Berger recounts his experiences helping companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and the Gates Foundation with behavior change. Despite various pushing strategies, many change efforts failed, prompting him to explore alternatives.
* **Inspiration from Chemistry – The Role of Catalysts:** In chemistry, change (like turning nitrogen into fertilizer or oil into plastic) often requires high energy. But **catalysts** lower the barrier to change, enabling reactions to happen faster and with less effort.
* **Social Change Needs Catalysts Too:** In social situations, rather than applying more pressure (the metaphorical “heat”), we need to **lower the barriers** that block people from changing—just like catalysts do in chemistry.
* **Changing Focus: From Persuasion to Barrier Removal:** Instead of asking “How can I convince them?”, a catalyst asks, “Why haven’t they changed already?  What’s hindering or preventing them? What’s stopping them?” Understanding the frictions, anxieties, or uncertainties holding someone back is the key to effective influence.
* **Analogy – Unlocking the Parking Brake:** Trying to force change by pressing the gas pedal harder doesn’t work if the parking brake is still on. In the same way, identifying and releasing hidden social brakes is often more effective than pushing harder.
* **Widespread Impact of Catalytic Thinking:** Berger’s catalytic approach is based on years of academic research and industry consulting across sectors—from startups and public health to global tech firms—demonstrating its broad applicability.

**Key Insights:**

* Pushing harder is not the solution to change resistance.
* People resist being pushed; understanding their barriers is more productive.
* Effective change comes from lowering the psychological or logistical barriers, not increasing the force of persuasion.
* Like chemical catalysts, social catalysts create change by reducing friction, not by generating more heat.
* Successful influence starts with empathy and diagnostics—not just argumentation.
* Unlocking hidden “parking brakes” is often more impactful than adding more “gas.”

### The REDUCE Framework

* **Introduction to the REDUCE Framework:** The 5 key barriers to change—**Reactance, Endowment, Distance, Uncertainty, and Corroborating Evidence**—which together form the acronym **REDUCE**. Each represents a psychological or social friction that prevents change.
* **Reactance – The Anti-Persuasion Radar:** People instinctively resist when they feel they’re being persuaded. This “missile defense system” activates when they sense external pressure. To reduce reactance, we must encourage **self-persuasion**, such as by offering choices (menus) instead of commands, and framing directives as suggestions or recommendations.
* **Endowment – The Comfort of the Status Quo:** People are overly attached to what they already have or do, overvaluing the status quo. To overcome this, we must highlight the **cost of inaction** and make staying the same feel riskier or harder.
  * Example: A comparison is made to “burning the ships,” symbolizing making it harder to retreat to the old way. There’s also a mention of a strategy that influenced the UK’s Brexit decision by making leaving the EU feel familiar—like something the public was already doing.
* **Distance – The Danger of Going Too Far, Too Fast:** If a new idea is too distant from a person’s current beliefs or position, it lands in their “region of rejection,” where not only is it ignored—it can increase opposition. Successful change **narrows the gap**, focusing on small steps and identifying the “unsticking point” to **move people incrementally**.
* **Uncertainty – Fear of the Unknown:** New ideas or behaviors carry risk, causing people to pause. To reduce uncertainty, we need to make change **easier to try**—offering free samples, test drives, or low-risk experiences.
  * Example: These tactics work beyond retail—animal shelters, accountants, vegetarians, and organizations all benefit from letting people “try before they buy” in some form.
* **Corroborating Evidence – Strength in Numbers:** One person’s opinion often isn’t enough to convince others. Change requires **multiple sources of proof**. People seek social validation.
  * Example: Instead of spreading messages broadly, it's often better to concentrate influence, reinforcing change through strong, aligned messages from multiple, trusted voices.
* **The Role of the Catalyst:** Catalysts are those who reduce friction rather than applying more force. They aren’t necessarily better persuaders—they are better **problem identifiers** and **barrier removers**.
* **Not All Barriers Are Always Present:** Not every situation involves all five REDUCE elements. For instance, in one case reactance may dominate, while in another, uncertainty may be the bigger obstacle. **Diagnosis** is key to knowing which tool to use.
* **Reframing the Approach to Change:** This course encourages a shift in mindset—from forcing change to facilitating it. It stresses that understanding people’s resistance is more valuable than piling on more arguments.
* **A Universal Toolkit for Change:** Whether you're convincing a single person, transforming an organization, or disrupting an industry, the REDUCE framework provides a structured, evidence-backed method for sparking action and overcoming inertia.

**Key Insights:**

* Change isn’t about pushing harder; it’s about lowering barriers.
* **Reactance:** People resist persuasion instinctively—engage them in self-persuasion instead.
* **Endowment:** Highlight the hidden costs of inaction to weaken endowment bias.
* **Distance:** Shrink psychological distance by breaking change into digestible steps.
* **Uncertainty:** Minimize uncertainty through trials, demos, and low-stakes experiences.
* **Corroborating Evidence:** Reinforce new behavior with multiple, credible sources of corroborating evidence.
* The REDUCE framework equips you to identify and address specific roadblocks in different contexts.

## Module 2: Removing Reactance and Endowment

### Reactance - How Warnings Become Recommendations

* **Reactance = Resistance to Being Told What to Do:** Reactance is a psychological defense mechanism where people resist when they feel their freedom is threatened. It's like an “anti-persuasion radar” that triggers defiance instead of compliance.
* **The Tide Pod Challenge as a Case Study:** In 2018, Procter & Gamble (P\&G) faced a bizarre issue: teens were jokingly—and sometimes actually—**eating Tide Pods**. This started as satire and internet humor but quickly became a dangerous viral trend.
* **P\&G’s Traditional Response – Warnings:** P\&G responded by tweeting a clear warning and launching a PSA with football star Rob Gronkowski (Gronk): “No, no, no… Do not eat Tide Pods.” This was the standard playbook—issue warnings and assume people will comply.
* **The Backfire Effect:** Instead of discouraging behavior, the **warnings increased interest**. Google searches for Tide Pods spiked by 700% shortly after the announcement. Poison control cases also doubled compared to the previous two years combined.
* **Why Did It Backfire? Reactance.** The strong, direct prohibition (“don’t eat”) activated people’s reactance. Especially for rebellious teens, being told *not* to do something made the behavior more **intriguing, rebellious, or cool**.
* **Warnings Can Act as Recommendations:** Research shows that **“Do not” messages often lead to the opposite behavior**:
  * Jurors told to ignore testimony pay more attention to it.
  * Students told not to drink sometimes drink more.
  * Anti-smoking campaigns can unintentionally glamorize smoking.
* **The Teen Dating Analogy:** Just like forbidding a teen from dating someone can make that person more appealing, **forbidding an action can increase its desirability** due to psychological reactance.
* **Reactance Is About Autonomy:** People value their freedom of choice. When they sense it's being restricted, they **push back to restore autonomy**, even if that means doing something irrational or harmful.
* **Persuasion Must Be Indirect:** The better approach is **not to push** but to let people feel like they are **making the choice themselves**—this lowers resistance and boosts openness.
* **Broader Implications:**  The Tide Pod example is extreme, but it reflects a universal pattern. Whether it’s public health, marketing, or parenting, **overly direct persuasion can provoke defiance instead of compliance**.

**Key Insights:**

* Telling people what to do often makes them want to do the opposite.
* The harder you push, the more they resist—especially when they feel their freedom is under attack.
* Reactance is strongest in adolescents and in contexts tied to identity or autonomy.
* Warnings can unintentionally promote the very behaviors they try to prevent.
* Effective persuasion involves choice architecture—guiding rather than commanding, offering menus of options, or inviting self-persuasion.

### Need for Freedom and Autonomy

* **Loss of Control in Nursing Homes:** In the late 1970s, researchers from Harvard and Yale studied why health often deteriorates in nursing home residents. They hypothesized that the decline might be partly due to a **loss of autonomy**—residents lose control over daily decisions like meals, activities, or mobility.
* **The Arden House Experiment:** In a controlled experiment at a nursing home called Arden House, residents on one floor were offered more choices: picking a plant and deciding its watering schedule, choosing which movie to watch and when. Another floor received the same amenities, but without choice—plants were assigned, movies scheduled.
* **Striking Health Outcomes:** Over time, those given more control were measurably more cheerful, active, and alert. Most dramatically, after 18 months, less than half as many people had died on the floor with more choice, showing a clear link between autonomy and longevity.
* **Humans Have a Deep Need for Autonomy:** People want to feel in control of their decisions. They **resist feeling manipulated or directed**—even in situations where they might have independently made the same choice.
* **Reactance in the Workplace Example:** A boss telling employees to "be more innovative" or "speak up more in meetings" can have the opposite effect—even if employees already wanted to do those things. Now it **feels externally imposed**, so they’re less motivated to follow through.
* **Anti-Persuasion Radar:** People possess a sort of "missile defense system" for persuasion—they instinctively recognize and resist attempts to influence them, especially when their freedom to choose seems compromised.
* **Common Resistance Behaviors:** People may delete emails, skip ads, or refuse help at the door when they sense persuasive intent. Even worse, they may silently counter-argue—mentally building a case against the message rather than processing it neutrally.
* **Why Warnings Often Backfire:** The more directly you tell people what to do or not do, the more likely they are to do the opposite—because the directive undermines their sense of agency.
* **Solution: Let People Persuade Themselves**: The key is not to push or direct, but to guide in a way that allows the **individual to arrive at the conclusion themselves**—preserving their sense of choice and autonomy.
* **Three Tactics to Preserve Autonomy:**
  * **Provide a Menu:** Offer choices instead of a single directive.
  * **Ask, Don’t Tell:** Frame suggestions as questions to invite participation.
  * **Highlight a Gap:** Point out a disconnect between someone’s current behavior and their values, letting them resolve the inconsistency themselves.

**Key Insights:**

* Autonomy is essential to well-being and motivation, even affecting life expectancy.
* Directives often backfire because they threaten autonomy and trigger reactance.
* Even subtle nudges—like framing or tone—can influence whether someone feels in control or manipulated.
* Effective persuasion means minimizing resistance, not maximizing pressure.
* Inviting choice leads to greater acceptance and action than giving orders.

### Provide a Menu

* **Defaulting to a Single Suggestion Backfires:** When you suggest only one option (like a movie for the weekend), people often instinctively think of reasons to reject it—even if it's a good idea.
* **Providing Multiple Options Reduces Resistance:** Offering two or more choices shifts people **from counter-arguing to comparing**—they now ask, “Which do I prefer?” rather than “Do I want this at all?”
* **Workplace Example – Pitching to a Boss:** Instead of proposing just one project, suggesting two project options engages the boss’s evaluative mindset, making it more likely they choose one rather than reject both.
* **Consultants Routinely Use This Tactic:** Smart consultants never give clients only one solution; they offer two or three. This turns a client from a critic into a chooser—dramatically improving the odds of acceptance.
* **Parental Example – Choices for Kids:** Parents reduce tantrums by offering structured choices, e.g., “Put on your shoes or your shirt first?” or “Broccoli or cauliflower first?”—guiding kids while preserving their autonomy.
* **Bounded Choice is Key:** The goal isn’t unlimited options. Like a restaurant menu, the strategy is to provide limited, curated choices—**enough to empower, not overwhelm**.
* **Restaurant Analogy – Curated Freedom:** Italian restaurants don’t offer every cuisine, but they offer a handful of appealing entrees. This feels like freedom without chaos—exactly the feeling we want others to have.
* **Choice as a Psychological Tool:** Giving **choices creates an illusion of control**. Even if both outcomes serve your goal, others feel empowered and are more likely to agree or comply.

**Key Insights:**

* People resist being told what to do, but feel empowered when they choose.
* Providing even just two options dramatically reduces counter-arguing and reactance.
* Bounded choice is more effective than total freedom—it channels decisions while maintaining agency.
* Framing is critical: the same outcome can be much more persuasive when presented as a choice.

### Ask, Don’t Tell

* **Telling Creates Resistance; Asking Builds Engagement:** Telling people what to do often triggers resistance. Asking questions instead shifts people into an **active, participatory role** where they are less likely to push back.
* **Example – Nafeez Amin at Sherpa Prep:** Nafeez Amin, co-owner of Sherpa Prep, noticed his test prep students weren’t studying enough. Initially, he told them how much to study (100–200 hours), but this came across as harsh and unconvincing, leading to student dropouts.
* **Pivot from Telling to Asking:** Nafeez changed his approach by asking students why they were taking the GMAT and what their goals were. Students voiced ambitions like getting into top schools, which led them to reflect on what was truly required.
* **The Conversation Builds Buy-In:** Through guided discussion, students discovered on their own what scores they needed and how competitive the admissions process was. When Nafeez later mentioned the required study hours, they accepted it—because the conclusion aligned with their own reasoning.
* **Result: Tripled Study Time:** Students who originally underestimated the effort ended up studying three times more, purely because they felt ownership over the decision, not pressure from an external authority.
* **Questions Shift the Mental Role:** Like offering choices, **questions shift the listener from defender to explorer**. Instead of rejecting your suggestion, they work to answer the question, engaging cognitively and emotionally.
* **People Buy into Their Own Ideas:** When people articulate goals in their own words (e.g., “I want to score 750”), they commit to those goals. The **advice that follows feels like support, not imposition**.
* **Example – Start-up Manager’s Use of Questions:** A start-up boss wanted his team to work weekends. Rather than demanding it, he asked, “Do we want to be a good company or a great one?” Once the team said “great,” he linked it to working harder. Since they chose the goal, they were more willing to accept the associated demands.
* **Questions Create Internal Stakes:** When people make a public or personal declaration (e.g., “We want to be great,” or “I want to get into Harvard”), backing out becomes psychologically harder—they’ve staked their identity on it.
* **Asking Uncovers Useful Information:** Questions don’t just foster compliance—they help you learn more about the other person's motivations, assumptions, and goals, letting you tailor your influence more effectively.

**Key Insights:**

* Asking questions builds agency and engagement—people support what they help build.
* People are more likely to act on conclusions they reach themselves than on instructions given to them.
* Questions change the listener’s mental posture from resistance to reasoning.
* Commitments formed through answers are stickier—they anchor future behavior.
* Influence works better when you start by uncovering shared goals and framing your suggestions as natural next steps.

### Highlight a Gap

* **Highlighting a Gap: The Third Strategy for Reducing Reactance:** This approach draws attention to a disconnect between a person’s beliefs and behaviors, especially when what they recommend for others doesn’t match what they do themselves. It triggers reflection and internal pressure to align.
* **Thai Anti-Smoking Campaign:** A Thai organization filmed children asking adult smokers for a light. The adults, naturally, refused and explained why smoking is harmful—yet they were still smoking themselves. This highlighted the contradiction in their behavior and beliefs.
* **Impact of the Thai Campaign:** The video went viral and boosted calls to quitlines by over 40%. It was effective not because it added more information, but because it created **cognitive dissonance**—a tension people resolve by changing their behavior.
* **Why It Works: Internal Consistency Matters:** People want their values, beliefs, and behaviors to line up. When there's a conflict, it creates discomfort (cognitive dissonance), which motivates people to adjust behavior to restore consistency—often without external pressure.
* **University of California Santa Cruz – Water Conservation Case Study:** During a drought, researchers asked students to sign a petition urging others to use less water. Later, students filled out surveys revealing their own water use. Those exposed to their inconsistency (advocating conservation but not practicing it) shortened their showers by over 25%.
* **The Subtle Power of Self-Reflection:** In both examples, people weren't told to change. They were instead guided to notice a contradiction, prompting change from within. That’s what makes this method more effective and less reactive.
* **Use in Organizational Change – Killing a Stale Project:** In offices, it’s hard to end long-standing but failing projects. Instead of confronting directly, you can ask: “What would you recommend if another company asked you about starting a similar project?” Once someone says it’s a bad idea for others, it's harder to justify continuing it themselves.
* **Self-Persuasion Is More Durable Than External Pressure:** These techniques work by encouraging people to **persuade themselves**. Once they do, the motivation to change is deeper, longer-lasting, and less defensive.
* **Finding Root Causes:** Changing minds is like weeding a garden: you can’t just pull the tops off. Real change comes from identifying and removing the **root cause of resistance**, not just addressing surface-level disagreement.
* **Don’t Push – Guide:** Rather than pushing people to act differently, help them notice when their actions don’t align with their own values. That moment of internal contradiction is a powerful driver of behavioral change.

**Key Insights:**

* Cognitive dissonance—the discomfort of inconsistency—can motivate change more effectively than confrontation.
* Highlighting a gap works best when people reach the conclusion themselves, not when it’s forced upon them.
* People are more likely to act when they realize they wouldn’t recommend their current behavior to others.
* Asking people what advice they’d give someone else can reveal contradictions without sparking defensiveness.
* Internal motivation (rooted in one’s own values) is stronger and more sustainable than external persuasion.

### Endowment - Staying Put Feels Costless

* **Endowment as a Barrier to Change:** The second major barrier to change is endowment—the tendency to **overvalue what we already have**, making it difficult to let go of existing behaviors, choices, or beliefs, even when better alternatives are available.
* **PG&E’s Power Outage Study:** PG&E asked 1,300+ customers to choose among power plans balancing cost and reliability. Most people strongly rejected frequent outages, saying they’d need at least a $20/month discount to tolerate worse service.
* **The Surprising Group That Preferred Bad Plans:** A subset of people already experiencing frequent outages chose the worst plan—not because they were poorer or more price-sensitive, but simply because it matched their current experience. This illustrates **status quo bias**—people stick with what they know.
* **Status Quo Bias Is Everywhere:** Whether it’s food, brands, charities, or lifestyles, people cling to the familiar. Even after major medical events like heart surgery, only about 10% of patients change their lifestyle, despite knowing it’s necessary.
* **The Coffee Mug Experiment – A Classic Case of the Endowment Effect:** People were willing to pay less than $3 to buy a mug—but wanted over $7 to sell the exact same mug if they already owned it. The mere fact of owning it made it seem more valuable.
* **Ownership Inflates Value Unreasonably:** This is not just about physical items: students who owned Final Four tickets valued them at 10x more than those trying to buy. Baseball card sellers valued a card more if they owned it. **Possession changes perception**.
* **Endowment Extends to Ideas and Beliefs:** We don’t just overvalue things—we overvalue our existing ideas and practices. The longer we believe or do something, the more deeply we’re invested in it emotionally, cognitively, and behaviorally.
* **Homeowner Attachment Example:** Homeowners who’ve lived in a house longer tend to overestimate its market value, even after adjusting for real price factors. Emotional attachment increases subjective value and makes people reluctant to sell or change.
* **Endowment Is Subtle but Powerful:** The feeling of **“what I have is good enough”** is invisible but sticky. Staying put feels easy, natural, and costless, even if it's irrational. This false sense of inertia keeps people from embracing change.
* **Three Strategies to Ease Endowment:**
  * Surface the cost of inaction
  * Burn the ships
  * Frame new things as old ones

**Key Insights:**

* Endowment isn’t just economic—it’s psychological and emotional. We get attached not just to objects, but to identities, habits, and norms.
* The longer we have something, the more it feels like part of us, and the harder it is to abandon—even when it no longer serves us.
* To catalyze change, you must dislodge the false sense of comfort and value people place on the status quo.
* People often don’t change because staying the same feels easier and cost-free, even when it actually has high hidden costs.
* Surfacing those hidden costs—and reducing the perceived “loss” of moving on—can help people release their grip on outdated ways.

### Surface the Cost of Inaction

* **The Mountain Man Brewing Case:** Students analyze a family-owned beer company considering launching a lite beer to combat declining lager sales. They fear alienating their core working-class customer base. Most focus on the risk of change (brand erosion), but overlook the risk of doing nothing—a 2% annual sales drop that could eventually doom the company.
* **Pain Perception and Response to Injury:** Severe injuries (e.g., shattered kneecap) prompt immediate, aggressive treatment, whereas minor injuries (e.g., trick knee) are often ignored. Ironically, the untreated minor issues linger and cause more prolonged pain, illustrating how minor problems persist when they’re not urgent enough to act on.
* **Failure vs. Mediocrity in Business Projects:** Projects that completely fail get axed. Projects that underperform slightly tend to linger without being fixed. A consistently late supplier gets replaced, but a sometimes-late one is tolerated. **Mediocrity creates complacency**.
* **Endowment Effect Applied to Status Quo:** People stick with familiar routines, even inefficient ones, because they don’t feel painful enough to abandon. The perception of “not that bad” makes switching feel unjustified.
* **Jim Collins’ Quote – “Good is the Enemy of Great”:** Mediocre systems (schools, government, lives) persist because they’re “good enough.” True improvement requires **discomfort with the status quo**, which rarely happens when things are simply “fine.”
* **Sticking to the Old Feels Safe, But Carries Hidden Costs:** People view staying put as risk-free, but it's often the slow road to decline. Doing nothing in the face of decline (like in the beer case) feels safer, but leads to slow failure.
* **Loss Aversion as a Motivation Tool:** People are more motivated by avoiding losses than gaining rewards. Highlighting what someone is losing by sticking with the old system is more persuasive than just promoting the benefits of the new.
* **Reframing the Narrative:** To encourage change, we shouldn’t just emphasize how great the new thing is. We must also shine a light on the costs—time, money, opportunity—of clinging to the familiar. **Frame the old as actively harmful, not just neutral**.

**Key Insights:**

* People undervalue the cost of inaction and overestimate the risk of change.
* Minor inefficiencies often persist longer and cause more long-term damage than severe failures.
* Mediocrity induces complacency—terrible situations spark action.
* To overcome the endowment effect, highlight how staying the same leads to cumulative loss.
* Loss aversion is more persuasive than gain-based framing—people are more compelled to change when they feel they’re losing by not doing so.

### Burn the Ships

* **Burning the Ships: A Bold Strategy to Force Change:** Surfacing the cost of inaction works, but sometimes it isn’t enough due to the strength of the endowment effect. In some cases, people need to **remove the old option entirely**—or **make it painful to return to it**—to spark commitment to change.
* **The Hernán Cortés Story:** After landing in Mexico with 600 men, Cortés faced dissent among troops who considered defecting and sailing back to Cuba. In response, he burned all 11 ships, making retreat impossible and forcing full commitment to conquest. This radical action became a metaphor for eliminating the safety net to ensure progress.
* **Historical and Cultural Parallels:** The phrase “burning bridges” and the Chinese expression “break the kettles and sink the boats” come from similar military tactics where leaders eliminated the option of retreat to strengthen resolve and unify effort.
* **Sam Michaels and IT Upgrades:** Sam Michaels, head of IT at an entertainment company, struggled to get employees to upgrade outdated machines despite repeated encouragement. Many preferred familiar but slow systems and ignored the benefits of the new.
* **Burning Ships in IT – How Sam Changed Tactics:** Instead of continuing to push upgrades, Sam announced that old machines would no longer be supported in two months. If issues arose after that, employees would be responsible for fixing them. The perceived safety net disappeared, and more than half responded within an hour to schedule upgrades.
* **The Power of Limited Support (Soft Burn):** Sam didn’t force change or break machines—he simply stopped subsidizing inaction. Old systems could still be used, but the cost of doing so would rise. This shift reframed the decision and tipped the balance toward action.
* **Car Industry Example:** Car manufacturers gradually stop making or subsidizing parts for old models. This isn’t an outright ban on using older vehicles, but rising costs nudge consumers toward upgrading. It’s a slow form of “burning the ships.”
* **Inertia is Stronger Than We Realize:** Inaction is easy. It takes no extra time or effort. People often stay with old habits, systems, or products not because they’re better, but because changing feels unnecessary or hard.
* **Burning the Ships as a Tool to Disrupt Inertia:** When people face the reality that sticking with the status quo will be actively harder or costlier, they’re more likely to adopt new behavior. Removing or raising the cost of the old option removes the temptation to cling to it.
* **From “Is It Better?” to “Which New Thing?”:** When you burn the ships, people stop comparing the new to the old and start comparing new options to each other. This reframing encourages forward movement rather than backward justification.

**Key Insights:**

* The endowment effect makes people irrationally loyal to the status quo; sometimes it must be forcibly weakened.
* Burning the ships—literally or metaphorically—can eliminate retreat and accelerate commitment to change.
* People are far more motivated to change when the old path becomes inconvenient, unsupported, or unavailable.
* Removing the option of inaction reframes the conversation from “change or not” to “which change?”
* Taking away passive support for old systems (e.g. IT, outdated products) increases the perceived cost of doing nothing and drives action.

### Frame New Things as Old

* **Reframe New as Familiar:**  A final strategy to overcome the endowment effect is to frame new things as old, making change feel like a return rather than a leap.
* **Dominic Cummings and the Brexit Campaign:** In 2015, Cummings joined the Vote Leave campaign to convince the UK to exit the EU—a huge change after nearly 50 years of membership. He knew referendums often fail because they ask people to give up the status quo.
* **The Challenge of Changing the Default:** Staying in the EU was the default option and required no explanation. Leaving would mean untangling complex issues and persuading people to choose risk over familiarity—a tough task due to status quo bias and loss aversion.
* **The “Brexit Bus” and the Cost of Inaction:** To simplify the message, Cummings used a bright red bus with the slogan: “We send the EU £350 million a week, let’s fund our NHS instead.” This surfaced the hidden cost of staying—challenging the idea that inaction was free.
* **The Power of a Single Word: “Back”** Cummings originally used “take control” as the campaign’s rallying cry, but later changed it to “take back control.” That small word—“back”—triggered loss aversion and reframed leaving the EU as regaining something lost, not risking something new.
* **The Framing Worked:** Surveys showed “take back control” was four times more effective than “take control.” This subtle psychological shift made people feel like Brexit wasn’t radical—it was restorative. Eventually, the Leave campaign won.
* **Reframing New as Familiar is Common:** Politicians often use phrases like “return to our roots” or “back to basics”. Companies do it too—positioning new products as updated versions of classics, not drastic changes.
* **A Fresh Coat, Not a New Identity:** Cummings’ strategy shows that if you can present change as a return to a prior, better state, people are more open. It feels familiar, comforting—even if it’s actually a bold shift.
* **Reinforcing Earlier Tactics:** This builds on previous strategies like surfacing inaction’s cost and “burning the ships.” All share one goal: making the new feel less risky than the old.

**Key Insights:**

* People fear change—but framing it as a return taps into familiarity and loss aversion.
* A single word, like “back”, can shift perception from risk to restoration.
* Status quo bias can be tricked by repositioning the new as the rightful default.
* This strategy is useful in politics, business, marketing, and personal change efforts.
* Ease endowment not just by promoting the new, but by making the old feel already lost.
